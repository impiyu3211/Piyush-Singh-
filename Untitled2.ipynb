It enhances Python by allowing operations on entire arrays without writing loops, which speeds up calculations and improves readability. NumPy’s efficiency stems from its implementation in C, enabling faster computations compared to native Python. Key advantages include ease of array manipulation, compatibility with other libraries like SciPy and pandas, and support for linear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transforms."
